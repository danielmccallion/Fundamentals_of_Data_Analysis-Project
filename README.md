# Fundamentals_of_Data_Analysis-Project
Project for the Fundamentals of Data Analysis subject in HDip Data Analytics 2020-2021 

This is a project on investigating using simple linear regression to fit a line to a dataset and provide analysis. The dataset contains values of wind speed and the corresponding wind turbine power that was produced. These will be graphed and their relationship looked at.

All code is written in Python and stored within a single Jupyter Notebook and should be run with Jupyter. The dataset is held within powerproduction.csv

## Project Instructions:
In this project you must perform and explain simple linear regression using Python
on the powerproduction dataset available on Moodle. The goal is to accurately predict wind turbine power output from wind speed values using the data set as a basis.
Your submission must be in the form of a git repository containing, at a minimum, the
following items:
1. Jupyter notebook that performs simple linear regression on the data set.
2. In that notebook, an explanation of your regression and an analysis of its accuracy.
3. Standard items in a git repository such as a README.
To enhance your submission, you might consider comparing simple linear regression to
other types of regression on this data set. Rest assured, all the above concepts will be
explored in lecture videos and other materials in the coming semester.
